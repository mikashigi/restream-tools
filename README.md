restream-tools
==============

A repository contains various tools and scripts for GDQ restreaming.
Mostly for my personal use.

 * `discord_voice_chat_recorder`

    A simple voice chat recorder bot. For testing the mic and voice chat configurarion.

 * `commentator.html`

    A simple screen that shows GDQ original stream with Japanese restreaming chat for commentators.
    This exists in `gh-pages` branch, not `master` branch.
    You can use it here at <https://niw.github.io/restream-tools/commentator.html>.
